# Homepage

This app is the first one in which I will be constructing the site to function properly on multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and phone. NOT ultra-wide desktop monitors). There is also a focus on bettering my accessibility and semantic HTML on my websites, but the main focus is the responsive design.

Other than links, there is no real interaction with this app.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
