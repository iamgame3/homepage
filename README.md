# Homepage (WIP)

This app is the first one in which I will be constructing the site to function properly on multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and phone). There is also a focus on bettering my accessibility on my websites, but the main focus is the responsive design.

Functionality is undetermined at the moment, but it is unlikely that there will be much to interact with.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
